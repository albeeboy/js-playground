# JS Playground

A place to test out node modules and JS code snippets. Note that some of the code is from the [Udemy Learn and Understand NodeJS](https://www.udemy.com/course/understand-nodejs/) course. The playground idea was born out of a desire to try new experiments beyond the official course work.
